# Cheryl's Portfolio

### Naughty Dev Stuff
1. hosting on digital ocean because i am linux and vv cost effective
  - *considerations*
    1. cicd will be simple, stupid, slow
    1. metrics will be simple, stupid
    1. ssl cert will have to be manually regenerated
1. opting for a isometric app (purescript front & backend) for simplicity and because purescript is a dream to work in.
  - *other tools considered*
    1. isometric Rust app (e.g. warp + SSR percy)
      - pros: fast as hell, comfortable environment
      - cons: not as type safe, not as fast a cycle time
    1. isometric JS app (e.g. NextJS)
      - pros: comfortable environment, fast cycle time
      - cons: not type safe at all, not as bulletproof
  - *considerations*
    1. in some ways, i am the first to do this, which is always a path laden with hidden pits
    1. performance and ram usage will not be awesome, but they don't _need_ to be for an artist's portfolio.
